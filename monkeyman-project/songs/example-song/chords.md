# Example Song — Chords

Title: Example Song
Key / tonal center: D minor (suspect)
Tempo / feel: moderate funk / groove

Chords (bar by bar):
| Dm | Dm | Am | Am | Dm | Dm | Am | Am |

Roman numerals:
| i | i | v | v | i | i | v | v |

Per-chord analysis:
- Dm (i)
  - Chord tones: D F A
  - Typical tensions: C (7), E (9)
  - Suggested scales: D natural minor (Aeolian), D minor pentatonic for bluesier lines
  - Target notes: F (minor 3rd), C (7th)
  - Arpeggio: D‑F‑A ascending/descending
  - Motif idea: F‑A‑D rhythmically syncopated; sequence to Am
  - Practice task: play only chord tones on beats 1 & 3 for 8 bars at 60 BPM

- Am (v)
  - Chord tones: A C E
  - Typical tensions: G (7), B (9) if A becomes A7
  - Suggested scales: A natural minor (Aeolian) or A minor pentatonic
  - Target notes: C (minor 3rd), E (5th)
  - Arpeggio: A‑C‑E
  - Motif idea: echo Dm motif moved to C target; use half‑step approach to C
  - Practice task: sequence motif across the two bars; record one take

Short soloing idea:
- Pick F as a motif anchor on Dm and C on Am; use enclosure (above/below semitone) into the target notes on the downbeat of each chord.

Notes
- If Am is later changed to A or A7, treat that chord as a dominant and use A Mixolydian / A altered choices accordingly.
