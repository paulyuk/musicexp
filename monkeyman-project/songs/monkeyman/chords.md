# Monkey Man — Chords

Source: moved from `initialchords.md`; chords corrected by user.

Key / tonal center: D minor (Aeolian), with dominant V (A or A7) and a secondary dominant (E → A)
Tempo / feel: funky/jazzy groove

Notation
- Parentheses indicate a short lead‑in chord (<1 bar). If you want exact beats, annotate like `(Gm/A - 1 beat)`.
- `→` indicates resolution within the same bar.
- Two chords in one cell imply a split bar (typically 2+2 beats unless specified).
- Example (explicit beats): `| Gm (2) | (Gm/A 1) → Bbmaj7 (1) |` means Gm for two beats, Gm/A for one beat, Bbmaj7 for one beat.

## Verse (8 bars)
| Dm | Dm | Am | Am |
| Dm | Dm | Am | Am |

Roman numerals (D minor):
| i | i | v | v |
| i | i | v | v |

## Chorus (progression)
| Gm | (Gm/A) → Bbmaj7 | (E/G#) → A | (A/G) → Dm |

Roman numerals (D minor):
| iv | V7sus → VImaj7 | V/V → V | V7 → i |

Note: if transitioning to the outro instead of the verse, interpret final resolution as `(A/G) → Fmaj (III)`.

## Outro (8 bars)
| Fmaj | Fmaj | Amaj | Amaj |
| Gm | Bbmaj7 | E/G# → A | (A/G) → Fmaj (or Dm) |

Roman numerals (D minor):
| III | III | V | V |
| iv | VImaj7 | V/V → V | V7 → III (or → i) |

## Per‑chord quick analysis (expanded)

- Dm (i)
  - Tones: D F A (C=7). Tensions: E(9)
  - Scales: D Aeolian; D Dorian if C# appears later; D minor pentatonic for rock/blues
  - Targets: F (3rd), C (7th)
  - Arpeggios: D‑F‑A (triad) and D‑F‑A‑C (Dm7)

- Am (v)
  - Tones: A C E (G=7 if Am7)
  - Scales: A Aeolian or A minor pentatonic; you can also stay in D Aeolian and target C/E
  - Targets: C (3rd), E (5th)
  - Arpeggios: A‑C‑E (triad) and A‑C‑E‑G (Am7)

- Gm (iv) / Gm/A (short lead‑in)
  - Function: iv moving to a V7sus-like sound over an A bass; short and chromatic — usually a 1‑beat passing cell.
  - Interpretation options (pick one based on context):
    1. Treat as a Gm triad with A in the bass (Gm over A). Solo approach: use G Aeolian / G Dorian and target Bb or D as immediate guide tones.
    2. Treat as a sus/upper‑structure over A (A7sus4 flavor). Solo approach: target the A chord tones (C# if present) as the suspension resolves.
  - Practical soloing choices (1‑beat rule): keep it simple — play one clear target or a two‑note enclosure.
  - Example approach (fast): over `Gm (2 beats)` play a short arpeggio or motif built from Gm (G‑Bb‑D); on `(Gm/A) 1 beat` play `A -> Bb` (two eighths) and land on `D` (3rd of Bbmaj7) on the downbeat.
  - Small practice task: loop `| Gm (2) | (Gm/A 1) → Bbmaj7 (1) |` at 60 BPM and practice the 1‑beat approach `A -> Bb` as an enclosure to Bb's 3rd (D).

- Bbmaj7 (VImaj7)
  - Tones: Bb D F A
  - Scales: Bb Ionian; try emphasizing the A (maj7) for subtle lift
  - Targets: D (3rd), F (5th), A (maj7)
  - Arpeggios: Bb‑D‑F‑A

- E/G# (V/V, first inversion)
  - Function: a chromatic approach to A (dominant). If voiced E G# B( D) etc it behaves like an E7(9) missing root; it wants to move to A.
  - Scales: E Mixolydian (if major) or E altered (if altered), but since it's brief, playing a scalar slide in E major/minor pentatonic to highlight G# works well.
  - Targets: G# (3rd), B (5th), D (b7 if present)

- A / A/G (V then brief V7 with 7 in bass)
  - A may be A or A7; A/G typically indicates the dominant with the 7th in the bass used as a passing tone back to Dm (i) or, in the Outro, to Fmaj (III).
  - Scales: A Mixolydian for major V feel; A altered (super‑Locrian) if the dominant is being made tense. For short lead‑ins use A pentatonic or A Mixolydian fragments.
  - Targets: C# (3rd) resolves to D (tonic) or to A (in Fmaj); G (7th) resolves down to F
  - Example approach: over `A` outline A or A7 arpeggio (A‑C#‑E‑G); over `(A/G)` play a descending enclosures into F (or D) like `G -> F` or use `G -> E` then land on D for tonic.

- Fmaj (III)
  - Tones: F A C
  - Role: relative major color; connects smoothly to A (common tone A)

### Why F → A (brief explanation and example)
- Functional reason: in D minor, A (A major or A7) functions as V by containing C# — the raised 7th (C#) creates strong pull toward the tonic D.
- Voice‑leading: F major = F–A–C → A major = A–C#–E. The note A is common; the C typically raises to C# (chromatic alteration) and F can move down to E — only one pitch needs a chromatic change, so the move is economical and sounds smooth while increasing tension.
- Color: root motion up a major third (F → A) is a chromatic mediant relationship; it adds color and an emotional lift compared with standard stepwise progressions.

Example 2‑bar phrase (4/4) demonstrating the voice‑leading
- Bar 1 (F): F (quarter) — A (quarter) — C (quarter) — A (quarter)
- Bar 2 (A): C# (quarter) — E (quarter) — A (quarter) — D (quarter)  → resolve to Dm

Practice note: loop the 2 bars at a slow tempo (60 BPM). Emphasize the chromatic shift C → C# and treat A as the pivot/common tone while aiming to resolve to D on the next bar.

### Outro — focused analysis
- Progression: `| Fmaj | Fmaj | Amaj | Amaj | Gm | Bbmaj7 | E/G# → A | (A/G) → Fmaj (or Dm) |`
- Big picture: the first half (Fmaj → Amaj) alternates III → V (dominant color), while the second half uses iv → VImaj7 leading into a dominant approach (V/V → V) that resolves either to III (Fmaj) or back to the tonic i (Dm).
- Voice‑leading & targets:
  - Use A as a pivot/common‑tone between F and A chords; target C# on the A chord as the leading tone to D.
  - Over E/G# emphasize G# (3rd) to sell the V/V approach into A; on `(A/G)` treat the G in the bass as the 7th resolving down to F (or resolving into D if returning to tonic).
- Soloing suggestions:
  - Over the first Fmaj pair, use F Ionian or D Aeolian motifs — emphasize A as a common tone.
  - Over Amaj (dominant) emphasize A arpeggios and C# to build pull.
  - On the final `(A/G)` try a descending enclosure `G -> E -> F` (or `G -> F -> D` if resolving to tonic) to make the bass movement feel conclusive.
- Example phrase for the full outro chain (one idea):
  - F (arpeggio): F - A - C - A
  - A (arpeggio): C# - E - A - C#
  - Gm → Bbmaj7 (short): Bb - D - F - A
  - E/G# → A → (A/G) → F: G# - B - D -> C# - E - A -> G - F (resolve)
- Outro practice tasks:
  - Loop the last 4 bars (Gm | Bbmaj7 | E/G# → A | (A/G) → Fmaj) and practice landing on the target guide‑tones (D on Bbmaj7, G# on E/G#, C# on A, F on Fmaj).
  - Practice the final `(A/G) → Fmaj` both as a short descent (G → F) and as a full V → I (A → Dm) resolution to hear both colors.

## Practice tasks (short)
- Guide‑tones only: play just 3rds/7ths through Verse at 60→80 BPM (F/C on Dm, C/E on Am).
- Chorus voice‑leading: over Gm/A (short lead‑in) resolve sus to A’s 3rd (C#) before moving on.
- Dominant chain: outline E (V/V) → A (V) with arpeggios; resolve to Dm on bar 1 of next section.
- Motif: 3‑note cell on Dm (F‑A‑D) sequenced to Am (C‑E‑A); add chromatic enclosure to each target.
- Loop the 1‑beat lead‑in cell separately: set a loop of `(Gm/A)` and practice a clean `A -> Bb` approach into `Bbmaj7` until it feels seamless.
