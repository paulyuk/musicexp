# Monkey Man — Melody

Short motifs, lead‑in phrases, and playable licks for practice.

## Notation conventions
- `|` separates bars. Parentheses indicate short lead‑ins.
- Use `→` to indicate immediate resolution.
- Quarter / eighth rhythm notated loosely as sequences for ear‑training; feel free to transcribe to TAB or staff if you prefer.

## Lead‑in motif (Chorus)
- `| Gm (2) | (Gm/A 1) → Bbmaj7 (1) |`
- Playable 1‑bar idea (8th‑note cells): D – F – G – A | A – Bb – D (land) — repeat

## Short lick for Outro (2 bars)
- Bar 1 (Fmaj): A – C – F – A
- Bar 2 (Amaj): C# – E – A – C# → (A/G) descend G – F (resolve)

## Practice tasks
- Loop the chorus lead‑in and practice playing the enclosure `A -> Bb` on the `(Gm/A)` beat until it locks.
- Improvise 8 bars using only chord tones (one per chord) and gradually add passing notes.

## Notated motivic phrase (playable)
- 4/4: (tempo ~80 bpm)
- Bar 1 (Dm): F (1) – A (and) – D (2) – F (and)
- Bar 2 (Am): E (1) – C (and) – A (2) – E (and)
- Bar 3 (Gm | Bbmaj7): short lead‑in enclosure — A – Bb – D – (land on D)
- Bar 4 (E/G# → A): G# – B – D – C# – E – A (resolve)

Notes: transpose to a comfortable register for practice on guitar or piano. The motifs above are intentionally small; repeat and vary dynamics and articulations.
